                <h2>Chicken</h2>
                <p>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus
                gallus). They are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of
                2018[1], up from more than 19 billion in 2011.[2] There are more chickens in the world than any other bird or
                domesticated fowl.[2] Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less
                commonly, as pets. Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until
                the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).[3][4]
                
                Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5] but with the
                clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian subcontinent. From ancient
                India, the domesticated chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[6] Fowl had
                been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come to Egypt from
                the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose.In the UK and Ireland, adult male chickens over the age of one year are primarily known as cocks, whereas in the United
                States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, they are more commonly called roosters. Males less than a year old are
                cockerels.[10] Castrated or neutered roosters are called capons (surgical and chemical castration are now illegal in
                some parts of the world). Females over a year old are known as hens, and younger females as pullets,[11] although in the
                egg-laying industry, a pullet becomes a hen when she begins to lay eggs, at 16 to 20 weeks of age. In Australia and New
                Zealand (also sometimes in Britain), there is a generic term chook /tʃʊk/ to describe all ages and both sexes.[12] The
                young are often called chicks.
                
                Chicken originally referred to young domestic fowl.[13] The species as a whole was then called domestic fowl, or just
                fowl. This use of chicken survives in the phrase Hen and Chickens, sometimes used as a British public house or theatre
                name, and to name groups of one large and many small rocks or islands in the sea (see for example Hen and Chicken
                Islands).
                
                In the Deep South of the United States, chickens are referred to by the slang term yardbird.Chickens are omnivores.[15] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects and even animals as
                large as lizards, small snakes,[16] or young mice.[17]
                
                The average chicken may live for five to ten years, depending on the breed.[18] The world's oldest known chicken was a
                hen which died of heart failure at the age of 16 years according to the Guinness World Records.[19]
                
                Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed
                feathers on their necks (hackles) and backs (saddle), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those of
                females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed
                neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The identification can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually from
                the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be
                differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging
                flaps of skin either side under their beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the
                head and throat are called caruncles. Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these
                are more prominent in males. A muff or beard is a mutation found in several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering
                under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard. Domestic chickens are not capable of long distance flight,
                although lighter chickens are generally capable of flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where
                they would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so
                only to flee perceived danger.
                
                Behavior
                Social behaviour

                Hen with chicks, Portugal.
                Chickens are gregarious birds and live together in flocks. They have a communal approach to the incubation of eggs and
                raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a "pecking order", with dominant
                individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a
                temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially younger
                birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.[20] When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens
                to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may
                also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat.
                
                A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other roosters.[21] However,
                roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings. Hens cluck loudly after laying an
                egg, and also to call their chicks. Chickens also give different warning calls when they sense a predator approaching
                from the air or on the ground.[22]
                
                Courtship
                To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen ("a circle dance"), often lowering the
                wing which is closest to the hen.[23] The dance triggers a response in the hen[23] and when she responds to his "call",
                the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating.
                
                More specifically, mating typically involves the following sequence: 1. Male approaching the hen. 2. Male pre-copulatory
                waltzing. 3. Male waltzing. 4. Female crouching (receptive posture) or stepping aside or running away (if unwilling to
                copulate). 5. Male mounting. 6. Male treading with both feet on hen's back. 7. Male tail bending (following successful
                copulation).

                <h2>Beef</h2>               
                <p>Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef since
                prehistoric times.[1] Beef is a source of high-quality protein and nutrients.[2]
                
                Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts, short ribs or
                steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.), while other cuts are
                processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, are usually mixed with meat from older, leaner
                (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties called blood
                sausage. Other parts that are eaten include other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the
                reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain
                (although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, commonly referred to as mad cow
                disease), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters,
                or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some intestines are cooked and eaten as is,[3] but are more often cleaned and used as
                natural sausage casings. The bones are used for making beef stock. Meat from younger cows (calves) is called veal.
                
                Beef from steers and heifers is similar.[4] Depending on economics, the number of heifers kept for breeding varies. The
                meat from older bulls, because it is usually tougher, is frequently used for mince (known as ground beef in the United
                States). Cattle raised for beef may be allowed to roam free on grasslands, or may be confined at some stage in pens as
                part of a large feeding operation called a feedlot (or concentrated animal feeding operation), where they are usually
                fed a ration of grain, protein, roughage and a vitamin/mineral preblend.
                
                Beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, accounting for about 25% of meat production worldwide, after
                pork and poultry at 38% and 30% respectively.[5] In absolute numbers, the United States, Brazil, and the People's
                Republic of China are the world's three largest consumers of beef; Uruguay, however, has the highest beef and veal
                consumption per capita, followed by Argentina and Brazil. According to the data from OECD, the average Uruguayan ate
                over 42 kg (93 lb) of beef or veal in 2014, representing the highest beef/veal consumption per capita in the world. In
                comparison, the average American consumed only about 24 kg (53 lb) beef or veal in the same year, while African
                countries, such as Mozambique, Ghana, and Nigeria, consumed the least beef or veal per capita.
                
                In 2018, the United States, Brazil, and China produced the most beef with 12.22 million tons, 9.9 million tons, and 6.46
                million tons respectively.[6] The top 3 beef exporting countries in 2019 were Australia (14.8% of total exports), the
                United States (13.4% of total exports), and Brazil (12.6% of total exports).[7] Beef production is also important to the
                economies of Argentina, Uruguay, Canada, Paraguay, Mexico, Belarus and Nicaragua.
                
                Beef production has a high environmental impact per gram of protein.The word beef is from the Latin bōs,[10] in contrast to cow which is from Middle English cou (both words have the same
                Indo-European root *gʷou-).[11] After the Norman Conquest, the French-speaking nobles who ruled England naturally used
                French words to refer to the meats they were served. Thus, various Anglo-Saxon words were used for the animal (such as
                nēat, or cu for adult females) by the peasants, but the meat was called boef (ox) (Modern French bœuf) by the French
                nobles — who did not often deal with the live animal — when it was served to them. This is one example of the common
                English dichotomy between the words for animals (with largely Germanic origins) and their meat (with Romanic origins)
                that is also found in such English word-pairs as pig/pork, deer/venison, sheep/mutton and chicken/poultry (also the less
                common goat/chevon).[12] Beef is cognate with bovine through the Late Latin bovīnus.[13] The rarely used plural form of
                beef is beeves.
                
                History
                People have eaten the flesh of bovines from prehistoric times; some of the earliest known cave paintings, such as those
                of Lascaux, show aurochs in hunting scenes. People domesticated cattle to provide ready access to beef, milk, and
                leather.[14] Cattle have been domesticated at least twice over the course of evolutionary history. The first
                domestication event occurred around 10,500 years ago with the evolution of Bos taurus. The second was more recent,
                around 7,000 years ago, with the evolution of Bos indicus in the Indus Valley. There is a possible third domestication
                even 8,500 years ago, with a potential third species Bos africanus arising in Africa. [15] Most cattle originated in the
                Old World, with the exception of bison hybrids, which originated in the Americas. Examples include the Wagyū from Japan,
                Ankole-Watusi from Egypt, and longhorn Zebu from the Indian subcontinent.[16]
                
                It is unknown exactly when people started cooking beef. Cattle were widely used across the Old World as draft animals
                (oxen), for milk, or specifically for human consumption. With the mechanization of farming, some breeds were
                specifically bred to increase meat yield, resulting in Chianina and Charolais cattle, or to improve the texture of meat,
                giving rise to the Murray Grey, Angus, and Wagyū. Some breeds have been selected for both meat and milk production, such
                as the Brown Swiss (Braunvieh).
                
                In the United States, the growth of the beef business was largely due to expansion in the Southwest. Upon the
                acquisition of grasslands through the Mexican–American War of 1848, and later the expulsion of the Plains Indians from
                this region and the Midwest, the American livestock industry began, starting primarily with the taming of wild longhorn
                cattle. Chicago and New York City were the first to benefit from these developments in their stockyards and in their
                meat markets.

                <h2>Sushi</h2>
                <p>Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi]) is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi),
                usually with some sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ, neta), such as seafood, vegetables, and
                occasionally tropical fruits. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi
                rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).[1]
                
                Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice.
                It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types
                of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled
                daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.
                
                Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw fish, or
